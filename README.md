# CO₂ Shield Generator

## Overview

The CO₂ Shield Generator lets you calculate the environmental impact of a webpage and display it in your GitHub project as a [shields.io](https://shields.io") badge, powered by [Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co), which uses the [OneByte model](https://theshiftproject.org/en/lean-ict-2/) for calculating emissions created by The Shift Project.

## Live Tool

You don't need to download or initialise anything to use this tool. Visit the live version here:

👉 [**CO₂ Shield Generator**](https://https://overbrowsing.com/co2-shield/)

## Features

- **Badge Creation**: Generates a badge using the [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) service.
- **Markdown Output**: Provides a markdown snippet to embed the badge in project documentation.
- **Rating Details**: Displays the CO₂ emissions per webpage view, along with a breakdown of ratings.

## How to Use

1. **Input a URL**: Type or paste the webpage URL you want to analyse. Ensure it's a valid web address.
2. **Submit the Form**: Press 'Enter' or click 'Submit'. The generator fetches CO₂ data from [Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co/).
3. **View Results**: See the badge, the markdown snippet, and the detailed CO₂ emissions data.
4. **Copy Markdown**: Use the 'Copy' button to copy the badge's markdown and embed it in your projects.
5. **Reset**: Use the 'Reset' button to analyse another webpage.

## Example

Here's an example of a badge and markdown generated by the tool for our website's homepage overbrowsing.com:

```

## Rating System

The rating is based on the grams of CO₂e produced per webpage view for new visitors. Returning visitors have a lower footprint due to caching. The ratings are defined as follows:

| Rating | Color                                                      | CO₂e Emissions per View |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| A+     | ![A+](https://via.placeholder.com/15/58C521/000000?text=+) | Less than 0.095g        |
| A      | ![A](https://via.placeholder.com/15/20AE69/000000?text=+)  | Less than 0.185g        |
| B      | ![B](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2D8EAC/000000?text=+)  | Less than 0.34g         |
| C      | ![C](https://via.placeholder.com/15/C89806/000000?text=+)  | Less than 0.49g         |
| D      | ![D](https://via.placeholder.com/15/C05328/000000?text=+)  | Less than 0.65g         |
| E      | ![E](https://via.placeholder.com/15/B71E1E/000000?text=+)  | Less than 0.85g         |
| F      | ![F](https://via.placeholder.com/15/652A2A/000000?text=+)  | Above 0.85g             |

## Installation

### Install via NPM

To use `CO2Shield` in your project, you can install it via NPM:

```bash
npm install co2-shield
```

After installation, import and use the library in your project:

```javascript
import CO2Shield from "co2-shield";

const co2Shield = new CO2Shield("app-container");
co2Shield.initialize();
```

> **Note**: Ensure you are running your project with a bundler like Webpack, Vite, or Parcel that supports ES modules.

### Install for Vanilla JS (Using a `<script>` Tag)

If you prefer not to use a package manager, you can include the library directly in your HTML using a CDN like [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CO2 Shield</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app-container"></div>

    <!-- Include CO2Shield via UNPKG -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/co2-shield/dist/co2-shield.bundle.js"></script>

    <script>
      window.onload = () => {
        const co2Shield = new CO2Shield("app-container");
        co2Shield.initialize();
      };
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
